/** \mainpage
 * The purpose of this application is to simulate the quantum restricted
 * 3-body problem. This means that for the Hamiltonian in the time evolution
 * the Hamiltonian from the restricted 3-body problem is being used, transformed
 * to quantum mechanics. To be able to effectively time evolve the state,
 * the Split-Operator-Method has been used.
 * 
 * Please contact the authors for an in-depth theoretical description.
 * 
 * \section requirements Requirements
 * 
 * The application is written in C++, using constructs and syntax from the
 * new C++-11 standard. You therefore need a recent compiler supporting the
 * new standard. The application has been successfully built using gcc-4.6.1 with
 * OpenMP support under Linux.
 * 
 * Furthermore you need:
 * - Qt 4.7.1 or newer
 * - fftw 3.3.1_beta1 or newer, built with OpenMP support
 * - cmake 2.8 or newer
 * 
 * You could use an older fftw and/or one without OpenMP-support.
 * In that case you have to disable the OpenMP support in CMakeLists.txt
 * and remove the fftw_omp library from the linker in the same file.
 *
 * \section build Build instructions
 * \code
 *   cd build/
 *   cmake ..
 *   make
 * \endcode
 * The executables are placed in the build/ directory:
 * - quantum3body-simulation .. this is the main application
 * - two_dim_spo_TEST.cc .. a simple test application/example for the SPOM code
 * 
 * \section running Running the application
 * 
 * Start the main application using:
 * \code
 *   ./quantum3body-simulation
 * \endcode
 * 
 * It should be mostly self-explanetary.
 * If you want to use multiple threads for computation, set the environment
 * variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to the number of desired threads before.
 *
 * For example using bash:
 * \code
 *   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
 *   ./quantum3body-simulation
 * \endcode
 *
