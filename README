The purpose of this application is to simulate the quantum restricted
3-body problem. This means that for the Hamiltonian in the time evolution
the Hamiltonian from the restricted 3-body problem is being used, transformed
to quantum mechanics. To be able to effectively time evolve the state,
the Split-Operator-Method has been used.

Please contact the authors for an in-depth theoretical description.

Requirements
------------

The application is written in C++, using constructs and syntax from the
new C++11 standard. You therefore need a recent compiler supporting the
new standard. The application has been tested using gcc-4.6.1 with
OpenMP support.

Furthermore you need:
* qt 4.7.1 or newer
* fftw 3.3.1_beta1 or newer, built with OpenMP support
* cmake 2.8 or newer

You could use an older fftw and/or one without OpenMP-support you have to
adjust the main.cc and the build flags.

Build instructions
------------------

  cd build/
  cmake ..
  make

The executables are placed in the build/ directory:
* quantum3body-simulation .. this is the main application
* quantum3body_simulation_TEST.cc .. a simple test application for the initial SPO code
* fftw_separated_computation_TEST .. a test application to compare the 2x1D with the 2D FFT

Running the application
-----------------------

Start the main application using:
  ./quantum3body-simulation

It should be mostly self-explanetary.
If you want to use multiple threads for computation, set the environment
variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to the number of desired threads before.
For example using bash:

  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
  ./quantum3body-simulation
